                                The SEMINAR FOR ARABIAN STUDIES is the only international forum which meets annually
                                for the presentation of the latest academic research in the humanities
                                on the Arabian Peninsula (including archaeology, epigraphy, ethnography,
                                language, history, art etc.) from the earliest times to the present day
                                or, in the case of political and social history, to the end of the Ottoman
                                Empire (1922).<br />

                                                be accommodated in the programme, the Seminar's Steering Committee has
                                                to make a selection and it is seldom possible to accept all those submitted.

                                                Wherever possible, papers are grouped thematically and chaired by a specialist
